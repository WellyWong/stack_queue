From "Introduction to Algorithm", Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein
"10.1 Stacks and queues
Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set
by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a stack, the element deleted from
the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a last-in, first-out,
or LIFO, policy. Similarly, in a queue, the element deleted is always the one that
has been in the set for the longest time: the queue implements a first-in, first-out,
or FIFO, policy. There are several efficient ways to implement stacks and queues
on a computer."
Here, I use a simple array to implement each.
